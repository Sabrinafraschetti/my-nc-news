# Northcoders News API

In order to sucessfully connect to the two databases used in this project and be able to run it locally, you will need to create two .env files: .env.test and .env.development. 

You will then need to add PGDATABASE= nc_news into the .env.development file and PGDATABASE= nc_news_test into the .env.test file. These files will e gitignored automatically.
